# Labyrinth2
This project is inspired by the real board game [Labyrinth by Ravensburger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labyrinth_(board_game)).

To start the project front-end Main.java class should be run. 

Our team has undertaken a university project with the objective of enhancing the work of a previous team. Our efforts have involved substantial improvements to the project's overall design, rigorous testing and debugging, the introduction of a game editor, the implementation of a new file format, and the development of both backend and frontend components.
