# Labyrinth2
This project is inspired by the real board game [Labyrinth by Ravensburger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labyrinth_(board_game)).

To start the project front-end Main.java class should be run. 

This is the University project at which our team has been provided by a previous team to improve their project as well as add a game editor to the project. 
During this, we've changed the general project design, tested and fixed big amount of bugs, added a game editor, new file format, backend, and front end.
